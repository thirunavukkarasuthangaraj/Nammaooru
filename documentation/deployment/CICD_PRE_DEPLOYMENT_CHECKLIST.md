## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Pre-Deployment

1. **Run Validation:**
   ```bash
   validate-migrations.bat  # or .sh
   ```

2. **Check Checklist Above** ‚úÖ

3. **Review Changes:**
   ```bash
   git log -3  # Review last 3 commits
   git diff origin/main..HEAD  # See what's deploying
   ```

### Deployment

4. **Push to Main Branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Monitor GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/your-repo/actions
   - Watch deployment progress
   - Check for errors

6. **Monitor Backend Logs:**
   ```bash
   # On production server
   docker logs -f nammaooru-backend
   ```

### Post-Deployment

7. **Verify Migration Applied:**
   ```bash
   # Check backend logs for:
   # "Migrating schema to version X"
   # "Successfully applied 1 migration"
   ```

8. **Check Database:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it nammaooru-postgres psql -U postgres -d shop_management_db

   # Verify migration in history
   SELECT version, description, installed_on, success
   FROM flyway_schema_history
   ORDER BY installed_rank DESC
   LIMIT 5;

   # Verify changes exist
   \d your_table  # Check table structure
   ```

9. **Test Application:**
   - Test affected features
   - Check API endpoints
   - Verify no errors

10. **Monitor for Issues:**
    - Watch logs for errors
    - Check error rates
    - Monitor performance

---

## üî¥ EMERGENCY ROLLBACK

If deployment fails:

### Option 1: Revert Git Commit
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Wait for CI/CD to deploy previous version
```

### Option 2: Manual Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# SSH to production
ssh root@your-server

# Rollback to previous Docker image
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

# If migration needs to be undone:
# Create new migration to reverse changes
# DO NOT delete migration files!
```

---

## üìä VALIDATION CHECKS EXPLAINED

### Check 1: File Naming Convention
- **What:** Ensures files follow `V{number}__{description}.sql`
- **Why:** Flyway requires this format to determine order

### Check 2: No Duplicate Versions
- **What:** Ensures no two files have same version number
- **Why:** Prevents migration conflicts

### Check 3: Safe SQL Patterns
- **What:** Looks for `IF NOT EXISTS` checks
- **Why:** Makes migrations idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

### Check 4: Dangerous Operations
- **What:** Flags `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`
- **Why:** Prevents accidental data loss

### Check 5: Transaction Safety
- **What:** Checks for `DO $$` blocks
- **Why:** Ensures atomic operations

---

## ‚ö° QUICK PRE-DEPLOY COMMAND

**Run everything in one go:**

```bash
# Validate migrations, build, and check status
validate-migrations.bat && cd backend && mvn clean package -DskipTests && cd .. && git status
```

**Expected result:**
```
[SUCCESS] All validations passed!
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

‚úÖ **Safe to deploy!**

---

## üîó INTEGRATION WITH CI/CD

You can add this validation to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

jobs:
  validate-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Validate migrations
        run: |
          chmod +x validate-migrations.sh
          ./validate-migrations.sh

      - name: Build backend
        run: |
          cd backend
          mvn clean package -DskipTests

      # ... rest of deployment steps
```

This ensures migrations are validated BEFORE deployment starts!

---

## üìù COMMON ISSUES

### ‚ùå "Migration validation failed"
**Fix:** Check error messages, fix migration files, re-validate

### ‚ùå "Duplicate version number"
**Fix:** Rename migration file with next available version

### ‚ùå "Migration checksum mismatch"
**Fix:** Never modify applied migrations! Create new migration instead

### ‚ùå "Migration failed in production"
**Fix:** Create new migration to fix the issue (forward-only migrations)

---

## ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES

1. **Always validate before pushing**
2. **Test locally first**
3. **Use IF NOT EXISTS checks**
4. **Keep migrations small and focused**
5. **Never modify applied migrations**
6. **Document major changes**
7. **Take backups before major migrations**
8. **Deploy during low-traffic periods**
9. **Monitor logs after deployment**
10. **Have rollback plan ready**

---

## üìå REMEMBER

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Run `validate-migrations.bat` before every deployment
- Test locally with `mvn spring-boot:run`
- Use safe SQL patterns
- Monitor deployment logs
- Keep migration files in version control

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Skip validation checks
- Deploy without testing locally
- Modify applied migrations
- Delete migration files
- Deploy during peak hours (for major changes)

---

**üéØ GOLDEN RULE:** If validation passes and local testing works, deployment is safe!
