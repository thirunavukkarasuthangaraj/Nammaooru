## 📝 Notes

### Important Considerations
1. **Current State**: This is a proof-of-concept implementation
2. **Mock Data**: All APIs return hardcoded responses
3. **No Database**: No actual data persistence
4. **Security**: Basic security configuration only
5. **Production Ready**: Significant work needed for production

### For Production Implementation
- Implement all database tables as per schema
- Build real authentication with OTP service
- Implement complete business logic
- Add proper error handling
- Setup monitoring and logging
- Deploy to cloud infrastructure
